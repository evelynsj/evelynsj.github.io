<p>Hi! My name is Evelyn, and I am a third-year computer science student at UC Davis. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern as a software engineer which truly sparked my interest in software development. I absolutely enjoyed the process of designing a solution at a high level to implementing and pushing it to production for many people to use.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about bringing inclusion to technology and making it more accessible. As one of the organizers of a social good hackathon, <strong>HackDavis</strong>, I'm hoping to encourage people to think about how they could build technology that benefit people who aren't usually targeted. Through my role as a facilitator for <strong>Girls Who Code</strong>, I'm also hoping to empower young girls of all backgrounds to explore computer science.</p>

<p>I'm currently seeking software engineering internship opportunities for Summer 2019! Feel free to review my resume <a src="">here</a>!</p>
